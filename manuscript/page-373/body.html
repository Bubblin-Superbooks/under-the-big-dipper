Not only my friendship but my eternal gratitude is yours.”</p><p>She found courage to turn and look at him, but quickly looked away again.</p><p>“Comtesse, it is not gratitude I care for. Will you do me a favor—will you make me a promise?”</p><p>Helène looked at him with wide, questioning eyes.</p><p>“I want you to tell me—that you will take no important step in the near future until I see you again. Promise me that you will call on me if you need help? Will you do this, for me, Comtesse?”</p><p>The deep, resonant tones in which he uttered these words swept over her like the music from a fine-stringed instrument. It brought from her responsive chords which found expression in involuntary sighs. She felt a curious pride and realized that she was happy and inexplicably glad to obey when that voice commanded.</p></div> </div>
