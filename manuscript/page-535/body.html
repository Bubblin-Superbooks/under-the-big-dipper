Surely their senses must get dulled and deadened in time! They crossed Broadway at the risk of their lives, as it seemed to her, but Margaret had Helène by the hand and laughed aloud. Soon they entered a quiet square in the center of which was a little park shut in by iron railings. Margaret explained that this was Gramercy Park where she lived.</p><p>Ascending the brown stone steps of a house near the entrance to the square, Margaret pressed the bell button. The door had barely opened when a loud, glad exclamation greeted the two girls.</p><p>“Oh, Miss Fisher, I am so glad to see you.”</p><p>“Hello, Jane! How are you? How’s Mrs. Kane? Well? Ah, that’s good. Tell her I’ve brought a friend who is going to stay with me. My room’s ready, I suppose? Good. Well, we’re going upstairs, but we’ll be  down for lunch. I’ll be glad to see Mrs. Kane if she can come up.”</p></div> </div>
