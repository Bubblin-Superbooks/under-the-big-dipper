And why didn’t he at least come to the border?”</p><p>Luckily it was dark. “More trouble coming—this young person has a mania for questioning!” Morton reflected, but he was now thoroughly on the alert!</p><p>“Oh, did I forget to explain that? Why, the General felt that if he were recognized anywhere near the Roumelian line, the alarm might be given and then my opportunity to get you two ladies away would be gone. The only thing to do was to be bold and avoid arousing suspicion. We were informed as to the conditions in Padina and elsewhere—through Baron de Haas, who wired from Constantinople, as you know. Where will he join you? Hm—I am not certain, but I have arranged to wire him the moment it can be done safely and I think he expects to meet you at Weimar. He will be there ahead of us, no doubt.”</p></div> </div>
