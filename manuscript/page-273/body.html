Isn’t it glorious outside?”</p><p>“Glorious, indeed. Don’t hurry. Call out the moment you are ready.

It’s so lovely and beautiful outside. I have just been speaking with Mr. Morton, who came to tell us that breakfast would soon be ready. I am so hungry that I could eat all Roumelia.”</p></div> </div>
