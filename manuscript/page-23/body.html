A heightened color mantled the brow of the sick youth and an elusive twitch upon the poor lips as they spoke: “How are you, Count? So you have caught me at last?”</p><p>The old man flushed, sank to his knee and with both arms extended, leaned over the invalid.</p><p>“God greet you, Your Highness!

Why should you still extend your love and care for one so useless as I?”</p></div> </div>
